					<h3>a story by ayla</h3>
					<p>Most of you know that Andrew and I met while working together at Normative Design. We didnâ€™t know it then, but we would soon find out that we were great collaborators in all areas of life. Since I recommended to my then-boss Jon that he should hire Andrew, I knew that I had a real respect for his brain. Before long, this respect led to love for his vivacious hair, playful grin, and generous heart.</p>
